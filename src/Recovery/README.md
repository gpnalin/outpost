# Recovery

In certain Environments, Outpost can provide information necessary to recover from errors. Exception classes that implement Outpost recovery interfaces are able to diagnose issues and recommend fixes.

Outpost uses [Kint](https://github.com/raveren/kint/) to format debugging information on Recovery pages.
